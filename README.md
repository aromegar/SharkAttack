## Analyzing a data-set with pandas to identify patterns in shark attacks

With this analysis, we try to identify wich are the most repeated patterns when a shark has attacked a human person.

A lot of individual events have been registered since 18th with the development of navigation around the oceans. In modern times, scientific societies have tried to standarize the registers throu a universal questionary wher data like place, time, activity, shark specie or victims' personal details have been stored. Despite that, there are still a lot of unstandarized answers in those questionaries.

Our task as data analysts is to clean data through all those singularities, and agrregate information to extract all kinds of conclussions.

## Goal

We need to clean the data with an array (pun intended) of techniques, and store this data in a clean data-set. Then, we will have to set three aprioristic hypothesis and confirm or discard them via data exploratory analysis. This conclusions should be shown graphically with the most appropiate charts.

## what is in this repo

In this repository you will find:

 - A readmi.md file with information about the project (this document).
 
 - A jupyter notebook called "Cleaning_Data_Sharks" with the methods for the data cleaning. As an output, it exports a csv file with the clean data ready to be further analysed.
 
 - A second jupyter notebook called "Visualizing_Sharks" with the DEA methods and charts used to confirm or discard the conclusions.
 
 - A "src" folder with a "cleaning_functions.py" file inside, where functions called in the Cleaning_data_Sharks jn are.
 
 - A gitignore file with internal stuff not for public sight.
 
## libraries

In this project we have used the following libraries:
    pandas, numpy, plotly, seaborn, and our own cleaning_functions.
    
    
# summary

We confirm our three hypothesis with the exploration of the data we have previously cleaned:

   - Sharks attacks are registered primarily in the summer, when most people dive in the sea for swimming or surfing.
   - South Pacific ocean (Australia and Micronesia majorly) and the Caribbean are the most dangerous seas.
   - The white shark is by far responsible of the majority of attacks.
